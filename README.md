# DamascoGuard
DAMASCO AI is a real-time security framework that safeguards AI-driven DeFi interactions by preventing prompt manipulation, data leaks, and unauthorized transactions. It ensures seamless integration with LLM providers and blockchain protocols, offering adaptive threat intelligence and customizable defenses.

## 1. Welcome to DAMASCO AI

### Introduction  
- **Prompt manipulation**
- **Data leaks**
- **Unauthorized transactions**

---

## 2. Why DAMASCO?

As DeFi integrates AI-driven agents for trading, asset management, and protocol interaction, traditional security measures often fall short in mitigating new risks, such as:
- **Prompt attacks**
- **Data poisoning**
- **AI-driven social engineering**

DAMASCO enhances security by screening interactions between AI agents, users, and smart contracts, mitigating these vulnerabilities.

### Key Industry References:
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2023)**: Highlights prompt manipulation and data leaks as top vulnerabilities.
- **OpenAI Security Best Practices (2023)**: Emphasizes real-time monitoring to prevent AI misuse.

## 3. Core Defenses

1. **Prompt Injection Prevention**  
   Detects and mitigates attempts to override AI behavior via deceptive user prompts or reference materials.
   
2. **Data Leakage Controls**  
   Screens inputs and outputs for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive transaction data.

3. **Harmful Content Moderation**  
   Blocks offensive, hateful, or violent prompts and outputs, fostering inclusivity.

4. **Smart Contract Integrity Checks**  
   Monitors AI interactions with smart contracts to prevent re-entrancy, overflow attacks, and unauthorized transfers.

## 4. Adaptive Threat Intelligence

DAMASCO continuously updates its security intelligence using:
- **Community feedback via the DAMASCO Challenge Game**
- **DeFi-specific threat feeds on known and zero-day exploits**
- **Research insights from academic LLM safety and financial cryptography studies**

---

## 5. Seamless Integration

DAMASCO supports:

## 6. DAMASCO‚Äôs Defenses in Detail

### Real-Time AI Firewall

DAMASCO intercepts every LLM request and response, using detectors to identify threats:
- **Block interactions outright**
- **Request additional authorization**
- **Sanitize content (e.g., redact harmful data)**
- **Log and escalate for admin review**

### 6.1 Defense Layers
1. **Prompt Injection Prevention**
   - Prevents adversaries from overriding system instructions.
   - Detects indirect attempts through reference data poisoning.
   
2. **Harmful Content Moderation**
   - Filters hate speech, violent prompts, and offensive content.
   - Context-sensitive filtering differentiates benign phrases (e.g., "I hate onions") from harmful speech.

3. **Data Leakage Controls**
   - Prevents unauthorized disclosure of PII, private keys, and financial data.
   - Custom detection patterns for domain-specific data types.

4. **Smart Contract Integrity Checks**
   - Monitors smart contract calls for anomalies, e.g., re-entrancy loops or overflow exploits.
   - Detects unauthorized fund transfers or sudden liquidity shifts.

### 6.2 Adaptive Detectors and Policies
- **Confidence Thresholds (L1 to L5):**
  - **L1:** Minimal false positives, only high-confidence threats.
  - **L4:** "Paranoid" mode‚Äîlow tolerance for false negatives.
- **Customizable Policies:** Tailor detection rules based on application risk.

---

## 7. Example Use Case

**User Prompt:** `"Transfer 10 ETH to 0x123..."`  
**DAMASCO Detection:** Flags the prompt as an unauthorized transaction request.  
**Action:** Blocks the transaction and logs the event.

---

## 8. DAMASCO Agents (Enterprise Feature)

### Overview

DAMASCO Agents provide centralized control of multiple AI-driven DeFi applications:
- **Separate agents for production vs. testing environments**
- **Custom policies per application or integration**
- **Consolidated monitoring of all interactions**

### Setting Up Agents:
1. **Create an Agent:** Name and tag the Agent (e.g., "Trading Bot ‚Äì Prod").
2. **Assign Policy:** Apply specific security policies to the Agent.
3. **Integration:** Use the Agent ID in API requests.
